This is my Web Developer Portfolio

## Introduction
For this project, I wanted to build my own website portfolio that would highlight my skills in front-end web development. Additionally, the website would be the go to place for accessing the web development projects I have worked on as well as serving as a online resume and cover letter for prospective employeers and clients.

The Website is a one page web applicaiton. Users can use the navigation bar to navigate up and down the website based on the content they wish to skip to.

The websites is hosted using Github Pages.
